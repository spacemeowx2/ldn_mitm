# ldn_mitm

A mitm kip modified from fs_mitm.


ldn_mitm implements LAN connectivity by replacing the system's ldn service.

The original ldn service is only responsible for calling the WiFi service to scan and connect to nearby Switch. ldn_mitm uses the LAN UDP to emulate this scanning process. Therefore ldn_mitm is usually used with [`switch-lan-play`](https://github.com/spacemeowx2/switch-lan-play). A configuration tutorial can be found [here](http://www.lan-play.com/install).

## Development

Make sure that the submodule is initialized.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```


### Using Docker
